     <p>Recoil, Derek Ramos, 2022</p>
      
     <br> <p>For my video project called "Recoil," I was interested in exploring different themes of feeling disgusted yet expressing your angst against the world. I wanted to create a chaotic and jarring visual experience that would match the intensity of the song of the same name by No Candor, a local band. I used analog glitch techniques along with found footage from movies, public domain videos and experimental art films to create an unsettling atmosphere. The goal was to make viewers feel uneasy while also providing an interesting visual experience. My main influences were from watching grunge music videos, Thrasher skating videos and work from new media artists such as Jane Veeder and Dan Sandin.
